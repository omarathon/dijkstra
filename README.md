# Dijkstra

C#.NET Windows Forms application that performs Dijkstra's Algorithm on an input network.

As part of a personal project implementing the algorithms learned in the A-level Mathematics D1 module.

- Fluent input of a network and the ability to view its corresponding distance matrix.
- Shows the shortest path with its weight, and a breakdown of the algorithm's working values.

## Files

Please find the main code files in [Dijkstra](Dijkstra), specifically the **frm<...>** forms and the **cls<...>** classes.

## User Guide

I published a user guide for this program a long time ago: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZfC6S_mrWijBPYAw-2V2PhdZWn_4Jn_F/view.

## Application Download

One may download the application from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7EPJOcG4kHSNDJJb0pLaG83Sms/view?usp=sha. Unfortunately it has various security warnings as I didn't know how to sign the program, but it doesn't have viruses: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/8513f09b32094a090c6b2036be6fba876d819ffc522db55cb53622d93b22f8d3 (one false positive). Feel free to build it yourself or run it in a VM if you care enough.
