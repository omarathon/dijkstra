# Dijkstra

C#.NET Windows Forms application that performs Dijkstra's Algorithm on an input network.

As part of a personal project implementing the algorithms learned in the A-level Mathematics D1 module.

- Fluent input of a network and the ability to view its corresponding distance matrix.
- Shows the shortest path with its weight, and a breakdown of the algorithm's working values.
